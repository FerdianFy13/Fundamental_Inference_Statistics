# confidence intervals for populations proportions

# * point estimate for a population proportion
# the probability of success in a single trial of a binomial experiment is p
# this probability is a population proportion
# in this section, we will learn how to estimate a population proportion p using a confidence interval
# as with confidence intervals for x, we will start a a point estimate
