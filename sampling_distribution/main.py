# sampling distributions and the central limit theoreom

# sampling distribution
# in this section, we will strudy the relationship between a population mean and the means of sample taken from the population
# a sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a sample statistics that is formed when samples of size n are repeatedly form a populations
# if the sample statistics is the sample mean, then the distribution is the sampling distribution of sample means
# every sample statics has a sampling distribution

# summary, sample distribution akan melakukan kalkulasi dari mean dari tiap sampling untuk mendaptakn mean dari sampling distribution dari sample n yang different
