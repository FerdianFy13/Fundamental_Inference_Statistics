# sampling distributions and the central limit theoreom

# sampling distribution
# in this section, we will strudy the relationship between a population mean and the means of sample taken from the population
# a sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a sample statistics that is formed when samples of size n are repeatedly form a populations
# if the sample statistics is the sample mean, then the distribution is the sampling distribution of sample means
# every sample statics has a sampling distribution

# summary, sample distribution akan melakukan kalkulasi dari mean dari tiap sampling untuk mendaptakn mean dari sampling distribution dari sample n yang different

# property of sampling distribution of sample means
# the man of the sample means meanz is equal to the populations mean u
# uz = u
# the standard deviation of the sample mean sigma x is equal to the populations standard deviation sigma divided by the square root of the sample size n
# sigma x = sigma / akar n
# the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means is called the standard error of the mean

# probability and the central limit theorem
# we can find the probability that a sample mean x will lie in a given internal of the x sampling distribution
# to transform x to a z-score, you can use the formula
# z = x - ux/6x = x - u / 6 / akar n
