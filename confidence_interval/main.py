# confidence interval

# 6.1 confidence intervals for the mean (sigma known)
# * estimating population parameters
# in this chapter, we will learn an important technique or statistical inference to use sample statistics to estimate the value of an unknown population paramter
# in this section and the next, we will learn how to use sample statistics to make an estimate of the population parameter u when the population standard deviation sigma is known this section or when sigma is unknown
# to make such an inference, begin by finding a point estimate
