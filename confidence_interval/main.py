# * estimating population parameters
# in this chapter, we will learn an important technique or statistical inference to use sample statistics to estimate the value of an unknown population paramter
# in this section and the next, we will learn how to use sample statistics to make an estimate of the population parameter u when the population standard deviation sigma is known this section or when sigma is unknown
# to make such an inference, begin by finding a point estimate

# * point estimate
# a point estimate is a single value estimate for a population parameter
# the most unbiased point estimate of the population mean u is the sample mean x bar
# the validity of an estimation method is increased when you use a sample statistics that is unbiased and has low variability
# a sample statistics is unbiased if it does not overestimate or underestimate the populations parameter

#* finding a point estimate
# x = ex / n
# this is called making an interval estimate

# * interval estimate
# an interval estimate is an intervalm or range of values used to estimate a population parameter
# to form an interval estimate use the point estimate as the center of the interval and then add and substract a margin of error
# for instance, if the margin of error is 2.1 then an interval estimate would be given by
# x += 2.1 or 
# x - 2.1 < u < x + 2.1
