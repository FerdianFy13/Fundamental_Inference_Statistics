# 6.1 confidence intervals for the mean (sigma known)
# * estimating population parameters
# in this chapter, we will learn an important technique or statistical inference to use sample statistics to estimate the value of an unknown population paramter
# in this section and the next, we will learn how to use sample statistics to make an estimate of the population parameter u when the population standard deviation sigma is known this section or when sigma is unknown
# to make such an inference, begin by finding a point estimate

# * point estimate
# a point estimate is a single value estimate for a population parameter
# the most unbiased point estimate of the population mean u is the sample mean x bar
# the validity of an estimation method is increased when you use a sample statistics that is unbiased and has low variability
# a sample statistics is unbiased if it does not overestimate or underestimate the populations parameter
