# confidence interval for the mean (sigma unknown)

# * the t-distribution
# in many real life situations, the populations standard deviation sigma is unknown
# so, how can you construct a confidence interval for a population mean when sigma is nott known
# for a random variable that is normally distributed (or approximately normally distributed), you can use a t-distribution
