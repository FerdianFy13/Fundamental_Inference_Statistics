# probability and normal distributions
# a. when a random variable x is normally distributed, we can find the probability that x will lie an interval by calculating the are under the normal curve for the interval
# b. to find the are under any normal curve, first convert the upper and lower bounds of the interval to z-scores
# c. then use the standard normal distribution to find the area
