# confidence interval for variance and standard deviation

# * point estimate for variance and standard deviation
# in manufacturing it is necessary to control the amount that a process varies
# for instance an automobile part manufacture must produce thousands of parts to be used in the manufacturing process
# it is important that the parts vary little or not at all
# we can start with a point estimate
# the pointer estimate for sigma2 is s2 and the point estimate for sigma is s
