# Hypothesis Testting

# * Hypothesis tests
# a hypothesis test is a process that uses sample statistics to test a claim about the value of a population parameter
# researches in field such as medicine, psychology and businees relu on hypothesis testing to make informed decisions about new medicine, treatments, and marketing strategies

# * starting a hypothesis
# a statement about a population parameter is called a statistical hypothesis
# to test a population paramter, tou should carefully state a pair of hypotheses one tahta represents the claim and the other its complement
# when one of these hypotheses is false, the other must be true. either hypothesis the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis may represents the original claim
# the term null hypothesis was introduced by ronald fisher
# if the statement in the null hypothesis is not true, then the alternative hypothesis must be true

# * stating a hypothesis definition
# a null hypothesis H0 is a statistical hypothesis that contains a statement of equality such as <= , = , or >=
# the alternative hypothesis Ha is the complement of the null hypothesis. it is a statement that must be true if H0 is false and it contains a statement of strict inequality suach as >, !=, or <

# * stating a hypothesis
# to write the null and the alternative hypotbeses translate the claim made about the population paramter from a verbal statement to a mathematical statement, then write its complement
# for instance if the claim values is k and the populations paramter is u, then some possible pairs of null and alternative hypothesis are:
# . {h0 : u <= k Ha : u > k} 
# . {h0 : u >= k Ha : u < k} 
# . {h0 : u == k Ha : u != k} 
# regardles of which of the three pairs of hypotheses we use we always assume u = k and examine the sampling distribution on the basis of this assumption
# within this sampling distribution we will determinine whether or not a sample statistics is unusual 
# the table shows the relationship between possible verbal statements about the parameter u and the corresponding null and alternative hypothesis
# similar statements can be made to test other population parameters such as p, sigma, or sigma kuadrat
